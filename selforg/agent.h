 *   $Log$
 *   Revision 1.23  2011-03-22 16:45:00  guettler
 *   - adpaptions to enhanced configurable and inspectable interface
 *   - name of Agent is now Robot
 *   - minor cleanups
 *
 *   Revision 1.22  2011/03/21 17:42:19  guettler
 *   - adapted to enhance Inspectable interface (has now a name shown also in GuiLogger)
 *
 *   Revision 1.21  2009/08/05 22:57:09  martius
 *   use new plotoptionsengine entirely

 *    internal state. Each Agent has an instance and passed it to the controller
 *    and the wiring. This is good for
 *   a) repeatability on agent basis,
 *   b) parallel execution as done in ode_robots
 *

 *
 *   Revision 1.14  2007/03/28 11:36:53  robot3
 *   Moved int t from private to protected area because the OdeAgent needs access

    You have the possibility to keep track of sensor values,

    The name PlotOptions is a bit missleaded, it should be "OutputOptions",

     guilogger or neuronviz.

    If want to log the position, speed and orienation of your robot

    Please be aware that the Agent inherits from WiredController. You
     might also find useful functions there.
