 *   $Log$
 *   Revision 1.6  2009-08-05 22:45:25  martius
 *   added plotMode
 *
 *   Revision 1.5  2009/08/05 22:32:21  martius
 *   big change:
 *       abstractwiring is responsable for providing sensors and motors
 *        and noise to the inspectable interface.
 *       external interface: unchanged except plotMode in constructor
 *       internal interface: all subclasses have to overload
 *         initIntern, wireSensorsIntern, wireMotorsIntern
 *       All existing implementation are changed
 *
 *   Revision 1.4  2008/04/17 14:54:45  martius
 *   randomGen added, which is a random generator with long period and an
 *    internal state. Each Agent has an instance and passed it to the controller
 *    and the wiring. This is good for
 *   a) repeatability on agent basis,
 *   b) parallel execution as done in ode_robots
 *
 *   Revision 1.3  2006/12/21 11:44:17  martius
 *   commenting style for doxygen //< -> ///<
 *   FOREACH and FOREACHC are macros for collection iteration
 *
 *   Revision 1.2  2006/07/14 12:24:02  martius
 *   selforg becomes HEAD
 *
 *   Revision 1.1.2.1  2005/11/16 11:24:28  martius
 *   moved to selforg
 *
 *   Revision 1.2  2005/10/24 13:32:07  fhesse
 *   comments adjusted and in doxygen style
 *
 *   Revision 1.1  2005/08/22 17:28:13  martius
 *   a 1 to 1 wiring that supports the selection of some sensors only
 *
 *                                                                         *
