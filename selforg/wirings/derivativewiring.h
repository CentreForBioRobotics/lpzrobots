 *   $Log$
 *   Revision 1.10  2009-08-05 22:32:21  martius
 *   big change:
 *       abstractwiring is responsable for providing sensors and motors
 *        and noise to the inspectable interface.
 *       external interface: unchanged except plotMode in constructor
 *       internal interface: all subclasses have to overload
 *         initIntern, wireSensorsIntern, wireMotorsIntern
 *       All existing implementation are changed
 *
 *   Revision 1.9  2008/04/17 14:54:45  martius
 *   randomGen added, which is a random generator with long period and an
 *    internal state. Each Agent has an instance and passed it to the controller
 *    and the wiring. This is good for
 *   a) repeatability on agent basis,
 *   b) parallel execution as done in ode_robots
 *
 *   Revision 1.8  2007/12/12 10:26:14  der
 *   MI: calculation of H(X) and H(Y|X) added
 *
 *   Revision 1.7  2006/12/21 11:44:17  martius
 *   commenting style for doxygen //< -> ///<
 *   FOREACH and FOREACHC are macros for collection iteration
 *
 *   Revision 1.6  2006/12/12 09:43:40  martius
 *   getDefaultConf1()
 *
 *   Revision 1.5  2006/12/11 18:23:11  martius
 *   changed order again: first all sensors, then all derivatives ...
 *   noise is only added to first sensor set
 *   now 2 functions for default configs
 *   blind motors not as sets, but as direct number given
 *
 *   Revision 1.4  2006/12/04 17:44:28  martius
 *   unclear
 *
 *   Revision 1.3  2006/12/04 16:05:10  der
 *   under construction
 *
 *   Revision 1.2  2006/07/14 12:24:02  martius
 *   selforg becomes HEAD
 *
 *   Revision 1.1.2.1  2005/11/16 11:24:28  martius
 *   moved to selforg
 *
 *   Revision 1.6  2005/10/28 12:05:27  martius
 *   adapted time horizont for derivative
 *    to quater of the time horizont of averaging
 *
 *   Revision 1.5  2005/10/24 13:32:07  fhesse
 *   comments adjusted and in doxygen style
 *
 *   Revision 1.4  2005/10/24 11:06:33  fhesse
 *   comments adjusted and in doxygen style
 *
 *   Revision 1.3  2005/07/21 15:09:00  martius
 *   blind motors
 *
 *   Revision 1.2  2005/07/21 11:30:59  fhesse
 *   started with blind motors
 *
 *   Revision 1.1  2005/07/18 14:44:55  martius
 *   wiring that supports derivatives
 *
 *                                                                         *
