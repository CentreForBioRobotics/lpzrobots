\dir selforg

The selforg directory contains the controller and a small framework to use them in different scenarios.
The class \ref Agent is a subsumption
of a robot, a controller and a wiring. 
The wiring specifies the connections between the sensor values of the robot
and the sensor values of the controller, and between the motor outputs of the controller 
and the motor values given to the robot. 
It also faciliates logging and plotting of parameters.
