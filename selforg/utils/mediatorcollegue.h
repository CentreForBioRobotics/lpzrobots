 *  Revision 1.1  2009/08/10 07:34:49  guettler
 *  -Base classes which support use of design pattern
 *   mediator - similar to callbackable, but with more functionality:
 *   The mediator takes a more central role in mediation, the collegues
 *   are able to inform the mediator that something happend with
 *   easy use of mediated events (MediatorEvent).
