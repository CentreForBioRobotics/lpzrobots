 *   Revision 1.6  2008-03-12 10:57:07  der
 *   added moving average MOVAVG
 *
 *   Revision 1.5  2008/01/17 09:59:27  der
 *   complexmeasure: preparations made for predictive information,
 *   fixed a minor bug
 *   statisticmeasure, statistictools: added support for adding
 *   std::list<AbstractMeasure*> to StatisticTools, some minor
 *   improvements
 *
 *   Revision 1.4  2007/12/06 10:18:10  der
 *   AbstractMeasure is now a abstract type for Measures,
 *   StatisticTools now supports AbstractMeasures,
 *   StatisticalMeasure, ComplexMeasure  now derived from
 *   AbstractMeasure,
 *   ComplexMeasure provides support for calculation e.g. entropy,
 *   uses Discretisizer,
 *   Discretisizer is a stand-alone class for support of discretisizing values
 *   TrackableMeasure derived from ComplexMeasure and provides support for calculating complex measures for Trackable objects

 *
 *   Revision 1.1  2007/05/07 21:01:31  robot3
 *   statistictools is a class for easy visualization of measurements of observed values
 *   it is possible to add the observed value itself with mode ID
