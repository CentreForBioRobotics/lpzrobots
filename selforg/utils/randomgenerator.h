 *   Revision 1.3  2009/07/15 08:33:58  guettler
 *   workaround for bug: drand48_r overwrites too much data
 *   - buffer increased (thanks to Joern Hoffmann)
 *
 *   Revision 1.2  2008/04/17 14:54:45  martius
 *   randomGen added, which is a random generator with long period and an
 *    internal state. Each Agent has an instance and passed it to the controller
 *    and the wiring. This is good for
 *   a) repeatability on agent basis,
 *   b) parallel execution as done in ode_robots
 *
 *   Revision 1.1  2008/04/15 17:03:34  martius
 *   random generator with state

  // which is not ensured if you have a struct.
  // So the 16 bytes are written into __x and __old_x, the call stack is save.
  // This isn't the best way, but everything which isn't predictable
  // is in a random generator perfect. :o)
