In this directory you will find the Configurator. 
The Configurator is a stand-alone tool that can be used for changing the values of configurable components. 
Configurable components have a list of key-value pairs, 
where the key is a string literal and value is a double value.

1.1. INSTALL & USE
TODO: describe how to install and use


1.2. FORMAT (Protocoll)

To Configurator (BNF notation):
\code
Conf             := <Comp>*
Comp           := <CompName> <Pair>*
CompName := [<string>][<int>]<newline>
Pair               := <alphanum>=<double><newline>
\endcode

the remaining tags are self explanatory

Example
\code
[Component name which can contain spaces and digits and .,- ][ID1]
key1 = value1
key2 = value2
.
.
[Other Component name which can contain spaces and digits and .,- ][ID2]
key3 = value3
\endcode

Answer: (from Configurator to simulation environment)\n
a) On change of a parameter:
\code
[ID] key=newvalue
\endcode
or
\code
key=newvalue
\endcode
the latter one means that the parameter is changed in all components.

b) Request of the description as defined above.
\code
#Something I don\'t care about
\endcode
