	to version 0.2
	* selforg agent and controller and abstract robot are moved to selforg directory
	and are cleaned of ode related stuff.
	Implication: - includes from selforg: #include <selforg/header.h>
	             - robots in ode have to be inherited from OdeRobot instead of AbstractRobot		     
	* includes are automatically copied (by link) to include directories in ode_robots and selforg.
	This occurs on make depend.
	* OpenSceneGraph integration!
	* OsgHandle is a structure that is needed for create an OpenSceneGraph note.
	* osg directory contains some osg wrappers for ODE objects and joints
