\dir agents

The agents directory contains the class \ref Agent which is a subsumption
of a robot, a controller and a wiring. 
The wiring specifies the connections between the sensor values of the robot
and the sensor values of the controller, and between the motor outputs of the controller 
and the motor values given to the robot. In the most simple case you just
put the values throug the wiring without changing them like in \ref One2OneWiring.
But the controller can also have more sensor values then the robot. For example you
can feed the derivatives of the sensorvalues in the controller as it is done in \ref DerivativeWiring.
Furthermore you can add or multiply the sensorvalues in your wiring or whatever you would like to.
