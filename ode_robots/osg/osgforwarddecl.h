 *   Revision 1.4  2010-03-16 15:47:46  martius
 *   osgHandle has now substructures osgConfig and osgScene
 *    that minimized amount of redundant data (this causes a lot of changes)
 *   Scenegraph is slightly changed. There is a world and a world_noshadow now.
 *    Main idea is to have a world without shadow all the time avaiable for the
 *    Robot cameras (since they do not see the right shadow for some reason)
 *   tidied up old files
