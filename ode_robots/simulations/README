/**
\dir simulations 

The simulations directory contains the different simulations originated from our work
on the selforganization issue.

You can just go into one directory, type \p make and after successful compilation \p start
to start a simulation. \n
For convenience you should start with one of the template directories like template_onerobot.
Both the simulation file \ref ode_robots/simulations/template_onerobot/main.cpp "main.cpp"
 of the template_onerobot simulation and robot definitions in nimm4.cpp are really good 
commented and therfore recommended as first example. You can easy find them by clicking 
on the tab  "Examples" at the top of the page.\n
For creating your own simulation just type:\n
<tt> $> ./createNewSimulation.sh template_onerobot my_sim</tt>\n
to create the directory \p my_sim, adapt it to your needs, run \p make and \p start and it should work.
