To start a new project copy one of the "template" directories and 
 adjust them as needed. 
Please note that you have to delete the CVS dirctory inside your copy 
 before you add it to the cvs repository.
A simple make in the simulation directory should be enough. 
In case your simulation code consists of other files than main.cpp, 
 please add them to FILES in the Makefile in the simulation directory.
 
If you insert a new file to the simulation framework, 
 such as a new obstacle, robot or similar you DON'T need to do anything. 
Every *.cpp file in the directories specified in Makefile.conf is
 compiled and included in the library libode_robots.a. 
In case you add a new directory with source files, 
 which should be included in the lib,
 then add it to Makefile.conf.
