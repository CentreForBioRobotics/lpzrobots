To start a new project copy one of the "template" directories and 
 adjust them as needed.
 
If you insert a new file to the simulation framework, 
 such as a new obstacle, robot or similar you need to do NOTHING. 
Every *.cpp file in the directories specified in Makefile.conf is
 compiled and included in the library libode_robots.a. 
In case you add a new directory with source files, 
 which should be included in the lib,
 then add it to Makefile.conf.
