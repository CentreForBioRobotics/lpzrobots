\dir ode_robots


The ode_robots directory provides all the stuff necessary for
 simulations with the physics engine ODE (http://ode.org).

\par Simulation Environment

The class lpzrobots::OdeConfig holds the configurable parameters of the simulation environment
like lpzrobots::OdeConfig::gravity, lpzrobots::OdeConfig::simStepSize, lpzrobots::OdeConfig::realTimeFactor and so on.\n
In the class lpzrobots::Simulation you find the functions to overload like 
  lpzrobots::Simulation::start and lpzrobots::Simulation::end which have to be overloaded by all simulations.
Addionally you can overload functions like lpzrobots::Simulation::config for configuration pusposes,
  lpzrobots::Simulation::command to react on keystrokes, and some more.

\par Simulation objects and more

The things inside the simulation environment (and some additional stuff) is inside 
the following subdirectories
- \ref ode_robots/simulations "simulations" :
	ready to use simulations
- \ref ode_robots/agents "agents":
 	structure to build a "complete" agent (consisting of a controller, 
	a robot and the wiring in between), different wirings
- \ref ode_robots/robots "robots":
	our robots,creatures, vehicles or whatever you would like to call 
	them are in this directory
- \ref ode_robots/osg "osg primitives":
	many classes for the osg and ode integration. 
	It provides Primitives and Joints of which robots and obstacles can be assembled, 
          and further helpful things to deal with OSG
- \ref ode_robots/motors "motors":
	a few additional motors (PID servos)
- \ref ode_robots/sensors "senors":
	up to now an infrared-sensor and a sensorbank is available
- \ref ode_robots/obstacles "obstacles":
	passive obstacles like different kinds of playgrounds, a sphere and usage of terrains
- \ref ode_robots/utils "utils":
	all the little things that make life easier
- \ref ode_robots/ode_patches "ode_patches":
	our patches for ODE 0.5 and drawstuff which are not used anymore
- \ref ode_robots/textures "textures":
	our textures used in the simulations and a program for calculating heigtmaps



\par How to start your own simulation

To start a new project it is recommended to copy one of the existing simulations from <tt>ode_robots/simulations/</tt> e.g. one of the "template" folders.
To easy the procedure use
the createNewSimulation.sh script in the simulations directory:\n
<tt> $> ./createNewSimulation.sh template_dir newsimname </tt>\n
where \p template_dir is the template directory you wish to copy and \p newsimname is the
name of the new simulation you wish to create. This takes care of your installation type
 and other things like possible superficial CVS information.

Example:
\verbatim
cd ode_robots/simulations
./createNewSimulation.sh template_onerobot mysimulation
\endverbatim
For user-type installation you probably want to put the simulation in a separate directory, that means:
\verbatim
./createNewSimulation.sh template_onerobot ~/path/to/simulations/mysimulation
\endverbatim

Now you can adjust the simulation as you like.
A simple make in the simulation directory should be enough. 
In case your simulation code consists of other files than main.cpp, 
 please add them to FILES in the Makefile.conf in the simulation directory.
 You also have to run <tt>make depend</tt> afterwards!

If you insert a new file to the simulation framework, 
such as a new obstacle, robot or similar you DON'T need to add them anyvery. 
Every *.cpp file in the directories specified in Makefile.conf is
compiled and included in the library libode_robots.a. 
In case you add a new directory with source files, 
which should be included in the lib, then add it to Makefile.conf.
In any case run a <tt>make</tt> in the lpzrobots directory, 
 this creates the neccessary dependency information to ensure a proper build.

\par How to add a new robot or obstacle or controller to your simulation
- Locate a similar object in the simulator. You find this under: \p ode_robots/robots, \p ode_robots/obstacles, and \p selforg/controller
- copy the .h and .cpp file to you simulation folder, e. g. \p nimm4.cpp and \p  nimm4.h
- rename it to whatever you like, say <tt>myrobot.cpp</tt>, <tt>myrobot.h</tt>
- modify the code so that the class has the new name, e. g. \p MyRobot
- change include directives to have a <tt> \<ode_robots/ \></tt> style. 
\verbatim
#include <ode_robots/primitives.h>
\endverbatim
- add "myrobot" to the Makefile.conf FILES variable
- run <tt> make depend </tt>
- ready to use the stuff in your simulation (use #include "myrobot.h")
