Description: Open Dynamics Engine - runtime library (double precision)
 ODE is a free, industrial quality library for simulating articulated rigid
 body dynamics - for example ground vehicles, legged creatures, and moving
 objects in VR environments. It is fast, flexible, robust and platform
 independent, with advanced joints, contact with friction, and built-in
 collision detection.
 .
 This package provides the shared libraries.

Description: Open Dynamics Engine - development files in double precision
 ODE is a free, industrial quality library for simulating articulated rigid
 body dynamics - for example ground vehicles, legged creatures, and moving
 objects in VR environments. It is fast, flexible, robust and platform
 independent, with advanced joints, contact with friction, and built-in
