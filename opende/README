In this folder you can find a copy of the ODE (http://www.ode.org) 
 that works with our simulations. 
It is a developer snapshot from a few weeks after the 0.6 release.

The recommended installation procedure is:
\code
cd opende; sh autogen.sh
./configure --enable-opcode --enable-double-precision
make
make install #(as root)
\endcode

On some linux systems it's necessary to run 
\code
ldconfig #(as root)
\endcode 
for a correct linking of the libode.so.

Please refere also the documentation in the opende directory.
