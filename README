/** \mainpage The World of Self-Organized Creatures
 *
 * \section General
 * 
 * This is the a collection of algorithms, simulations, and tools 
 * developed by the robot group of the University Leipzig. \n
 * http://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de 
 *
 * You need the following software and libraries installed (Tested on Linux x86 machines)
 * - ODE (with drawstuff lib (included)) see www.ode.org and augmented with our 
 * \ref ode_robots/ode_patches "patches"
 * - Qt library from http://www.trolltech.com for guilogger (version > 3.0)
 * - avr-gcc and avr-binutils. \n
 *    SuSE packages under: http://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/software/\n
 *    Debian includes them in Sarge
 
 
 \section Structure
 
  The collection consists of the following directories (click for details):
  - \subpage controller : controllers developed in the robotic group of Leipzig university
	yielding at self-organized behaviour for various kinds of machines
  - \subpage ode_robots : stuff needed for our ODE-simulations (Open Dynamics Engine, see http://ode.org) such as robots, 
 	obstacles, utils, our patches and so on
  - \subpage matrixlib : comfortable matrix library used for calculations e.g. in our controllers
  - \subpage gnuplot : tool allowing you to use online gnuplot windows within your program 
	(using pipe for data handover)
  - \subpage guilogger : application that coordinates multiple gnuplot windows and switches 
	channels on or of, where the data come per pipe from your program
