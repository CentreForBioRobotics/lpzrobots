 * \section General
 * 
 * This is the a collection of algorithms, simulations, and tools 
 * developed by the robot group of the University Leipzig. \n
 * http://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de 
 *
 * You need the following software and libraries installed (Tested on Linux x86 machines)
 * - ODE (with drawstuff lib (included)) see www.ode.org and augmented with our 
 * \ref ode_robots/ode_patches "patches"
 * - Qt library from http://www.trolltech.com for guilogger (version > 3.0)
 * - avr-gcc and avr-binutils. \n
 *    SuSE packages under: http://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/software/\n
 *    Debian includes them in Sarge
 
 
 \section Structure
 
  The collection consists of the following directories (click for details):
  - \ref controller : controllers developed in the robotic group of Leipzig university
	yielding at self-organized behaviour for various kinds of machines
  - \ref ode_robots : stuff needed for our ODE-simulations 
	(Open Dynamics Engine, see http://ode.org) such as robots, 
 	obstacles, utils, our patches and so on
  - \ref matrixlib : comfortable matrix library used for calculations e.g. in our controllers
  - \ref gnuplot : tool allowing you to use online gnuplot windows within your program 
	(using pipe for data handover)
  - \ref guilogger : application that coordinates multiple gnuplot 
	windows and switches channels on or of, data is sent per pipe from your program 


\section Installation

- Download the_world_of_Self-Organized_Creatures.tgz from 
  http://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/software .
- Unpack file.
- Change into <tt> lpzrobots </tt> directory
- Call <tt> make </tt> to compile \ref matrixlib and \ref guilogger
- Call <tt> make install </tt> to copy <tt> guilogger/bin/guilogger </tt> into the 
  <tt>/bin</tt> folder of your home directory. (If this does not work copy by hand.)
- To start a simulation go into that simulation directory, call <tt>make</tt> and 
  <tt>start</tt>.
  For example when you want to start the template_onerobot simulation type
  <tt>cd ode_robots/simulations/template_onerobot</tt>, then call <tt>make</tt> and after
  successful compilation type <tt>start</tt> to start the simulation
