\dir guilogger

A tool to customize online gnuplot windows online. 

\b Features \n 

The sentence above means that you sent your different data "channels" 
(a channel is more or less a variable observed over time equipped with a label) 
per pipe to the guilogger.
Guilogger provides a seperate window where you can choose which of the channels 
should be displayed in which window. According to your selection your data will 
be plotted online. \n
Furthermore guilogger gives the opportunity to save your data "channels" in a file
together with the labels you selected for the channels. \n
To do something useful with these logfiles guilogger allows you to watch them again
and navigate trough the logfile. Once you found a valuable figure you can use the 
gnuplot commands generated by guilogger. Copy this command in a console where gnuplot 
is running and you receive your figure and can save it to disk. \n 

Here you can see a screenshot of the guilogger window with 9 channels. 
The used labels range from "x[0]" to "y[2]". The top three boxes after the word "Channels" 
are useless at the moment.
