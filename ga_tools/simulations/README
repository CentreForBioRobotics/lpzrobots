/**
\dir ga_tools/simulations 

The simulations directory contains the different simulations originated from our work
on the selforganization issue in combination with genetic algorithms

You can just go into one directory, type \p make and after successful compilation \p start
to start a simulation. \n
For convenience you should start with one of the template directories like template_cycled_GA_Simulation.
