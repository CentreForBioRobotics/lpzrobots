/**
\dir ga_tools/simulations

The simulations directory contains the different simulations originated from our work
on the evolutionary issue.

You can just go into one directory, type \p make and after successful compilation \p start
to start a simulation. For a faster run you should use -nographics as parameter.\n
For convenience you should start with one of the template directories like template_cycled_GA_Simulation.
The simulation file \ref ga_tools/simulations/template_cycled_GA_simulation/main.cpp "main.cpp"
 of the template_cycled_GA_Simulation simulation are really good
commented and therefore is recommended as first example. You can easy find them by clicking
on the tab  "Examples" at the top of the page.\n
For creating your own simulation just type:\n
<tt> $> ./createNewSimulation.sh template_cycled_GA_Simulation my_sim</tt>\n
to create the directory \p my_sim, adapt it to your needs, run \p make and \p start and it should work.

\example template_cycled_GA_Simulation/main.cpp
 A simple example for the usage of the restart function for ga_tools inside the ode_robots simulation.

/**
\example template_tasked_GA_Simulation/main.cpp
 An example for the usage of the tasked simulation with ga_tools for a scalable set of simulation on many CPU's.
 So the ga_tool can simulate every individual in one separate thread!

/**
\example robot_chain_tasked_GA_Simulation/main.cpp
 A simple example which calculates the neuron values for the robot chain with the template_tasked_GA_Simulation.
