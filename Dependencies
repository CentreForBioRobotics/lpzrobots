Packages/Libs that are required by lpzrobots:

Debian based:
sudo apt-get install \
 g++  make  automake libtool xutils-dev m4  libreadline-dev  libgsl0-dev \
 libglu-dev libgl1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev  libopenscenegraph-dev \
 libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl libqt4-opengl-dev qt4-qmake  libqt4-qt3support gnuplot \
 libncurses5-dev

we actually need the metapackage libgl-dev but this has several options. So I picked the
libgl1-mesa-dev.


RPM based: (package names from OpenSuse)
zypper install gcc-c++  make xorg-x11-util-devel  m4 readline-devel  gsl-devel \
 freeglu-devel libgl-devel freeglut-devel \
 libqt4-devel libqt4-qt3support
check package names: automake libtool

openscenegraph is no available on SUSE
